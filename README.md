# avaj


Recent java syntax enhancement were clearly made by compiler experts to masturbate other compiler experts.

No one cares about the programmer.

This project tries alternative experimental syntaxes for java just for fun.

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-18.html


Current experiments:
* `public` keyword is implicit and can be omitted for classes and methods
* the "package friendly" visibility is stated as `package protected`
* `void` return type is implicit and can be omitted
* variable assignment is provided by pipe `|`
* parameter passing for methods is provided by pipe `|` 
* empty lines act as statement separator

Further trials:
* class attribute with no qualifiers interpreted as private attribute plus public getters and setters
* longer pipe chains (e.g.: method > method or method > variable > method)
* null-safe method and attribute access

Avaj was supposed to be a java superset, but now I don giv a fick anymore. It seems funnier and more productive just to keep the resemblance.

Avaj is an acronym that stands for:

A-vajisa  
V-ery
A-wesome
J-avaextension.
